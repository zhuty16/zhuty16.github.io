* ***Tianyu Zhu***, Leilei Sun, Guoqing Chen. **Graph-based Embedding Smoothing for Sequential Recommendation.** IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE) (2021). [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9405450?casa_token=H9BLiC5GkqoAAAAA:CDnkn4T_TlbDUPzMPVQZNata6XlS6t_precdKAZdH-Yymk4tBJNKrOknBU7cM9SaRFHJb_K84G8) [Code](https://github.com/zhuty16/GES)
  - This paper provides a general embedding smoothing framework (GES) for sequential recommendation, which performs graph convolutions on the hybrid item graph with both sequential and semantic item relations to improve representation learning in sequential models.
* ***Tianyu Zhu***, Leilei Sun, Guoqing Chen. **Embedding Disentanglement in Graph Convolutional Networks for Recommendation.** IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE) (2021). [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9449924?casa_token=6Hmtinsmm8wAAAAA:e2j--64R4J82dZMjKsQkHjj7TcfFGCKYPfNO8Q7d9EW5Ro7dWBpmQ5x8l6w7KzbbDiyR_Gp5TAg) [Code](https://github.com/zhuty16/CIGCN)
  - This paper proposes a Channel-Independent Graph Convolutional Network (CIGCN) that uses diagonal parameter matrices as filters to learn disentangled embedding dimensions for item recommendation.
* ***Tianyu Zhu***, Guannan Liu, Guoqing Chen. **Social Collaborative Mutual Learning for Item Recommendation.** ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD) (2020). [Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3387162?casa_token=CfxOOji5UukAAAAA:1qivs-DI3qza8LBX2tduTl2WvWvpKAmI5jRViBot-S6g64beMNWIc3xQVWP1FuVqChJSgcSQ_X0) [Code](https://github.com/zhuty16/SCML)
  - This paper proposes a Social Collaborative Mutual Learning (SCML) method, which designs two mutual regularization strategies to combine the item-based CF model with the social CF model to improve their recommendation performances.
